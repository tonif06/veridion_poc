# QC Flags — Data Quality Indicators

This page explains the **data quality flags** generated by the entity resolution pipeline.  
Flags highlight potential issues in supplier records that may affect **marketing campaigns**, **sales outreach**, and **data trust**.

---

## 1. Missing Postcode
- **What it means:** The supplier record has no postal code.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - Harder to validate the exact location of the company.  
  - Blocks precise geo-segmentation in campaigns.  
  - Sales may face delivery or compliance issues due to incomplete addresses.  

---

## 2. Missing Street
- **What it means:** The street address is missing.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - Record is less useful for direct mail or local targeting.  
  - Signals outdated or incomplete data.  
  - Sales teams may not be able to distinguish between companies in the same city.  

---

## 3. No Website / No Social
- **What it means:** The supplier has no website and no social media presence.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - **Marketing:** Digital campaigns (LinkedIn, Google Ads, retargeting) cannot reach these companies.  
  - **Sales:** Often smaller or less digitally mature companies → more effort, lower ROI.  
  - Risk: companies with no online presence may be inactive or closed.

## 4. Stale > 2 years
- **What it means:** The last update on this company record is older than 2 years.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - Old data = higher chance of **wrong contacts** or even **closed businesses**.  
  - Marketing risks high bounce rates or wasted ad spend.  
  - Sales may pursue outdated or irrelevant leads.  

---

## 5. Missing Company Type
- **What it means:** The “company type” (e.g., LLC, SA, GmbH) is missing.  
- **Why it matters:**  
  - Company type defines **size, credibility, and legal form**.  
  - Missing info makes segmentation harder (e.g., only target corporations, exclude freelancers).  
  - Sales lose a quick signal about company maturity and trust.

# How to Use Flags

- **Marketing teams**  
  - Filter flagged companies out of campaign lists, or enrich them first.  
  - Use flags to understand which data issues reduce targeting precision.  

- **Sales teams**  
  - Focus on flagged companies only if they are strategic.  
  - Otherwise, prioritize clean, reliable records for faster wins.  

- **Data/Operations**  
  - Flags are a **to-do list for enrichment**: add missing postcodes, update stale data, confirm websites, etc.
